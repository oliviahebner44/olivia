# File: average_vowels.py

# You’re curious about the average number of vowels compared to consonants in a paragraph.

# --- 1. Counting Vowels ---
# Write a return function that takes a string as input.
# The function should return a tuple containing:
#     (number of vowels, number of consonants)
# Name this function: counting_vowels_and_consonants()

def counting_vowels_and_consonants(text):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowel_count = 0
    consonant_count = 0

    for char in text:        
        if char.isalpha():   # if it's a letter
            if char in vowels:    # if that letter is in the vowel string,
                vowel_count += 1  # count it towards vowels 
            else:
                consonant_count += 1

    return vowel_count, consonant_count 

text = "happy birthday"
print(counting_vowels_and_consonants(text))

# Hint: You can use .isalpha() to check if a character is a letter.

# --- 2. Average Vowels ---
# Write a return function that takes in a paragraph (string) as input.
# The function should:
#   - Split the paragraph into individual sentences.
#   - Use counting_vowels_and_consonants() to count values for each sentence.
#   - Return a tuple: (number of sentences, average vowels per sentence, average consonants per sentence)
# Name this function: average_vowels_and_consonants()

    for sentence in sentences:
        vowels, consonants = counting_vowels_and_consonants(sentence)
        total_vowels += vowels 
        total_consonants += consonants

    average_vowels = total_vowels / total_sentences if total_sentences > 0 else 0

    "Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. "
    "Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. "
    "Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all."
